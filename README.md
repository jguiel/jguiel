My work repos are private, I promise I contribute a lot of commits :(

# Justin Guiel
What started as writing Python to help make my life easier at the lab bench grew into a profound respect for computing. My educational and research backgrounds are strictly biology with heavy focus on molecular genetics and microbiology, so I have a lot to learn to catch-up with my peers in engineering. I have been consistently teaching myself compsci the past 3+ years through textbooks and resources like MIT's OCW. I was lucky enough to break into the engineering world and get some experience under my belt, but my desire to learn more has done nothing but grow stronger

**Disclaimer**: The repos on this GH account are old pet-projects. Most of my code commits made money for my employer, therefore are *private*.
