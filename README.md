# Justin Guiel
I'm still relatively new to software. What started as writing Python to help make my life easier at the lab bench, grew into a profound respect for computing. My educational and research backgrounds are strictly biology with heavy focus on molecular genetics and microbiology, so I have a lot to learn to catch-up to my peers in engineering. I have been consistently teaching myself compsci the past 2+ years through textbooks and resources like MIT's OCW. I was lucky enough to break into the engineering world and get some experience under my belt, but my desire to learn more has done nothing but grow stronger
